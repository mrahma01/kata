The rules

Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizzbuzz. A player who makes a mistake has to take a drink. 
Einstein will choose a random number to start with â€“ for example: 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
